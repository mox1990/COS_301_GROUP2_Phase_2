Lower Levels of Granularity:
The levels of granularity are specific according to the various aspects of the program,
meaning the different aspects are ordered by a hierarchy in the system.
This order, from the lowest level to the highest, is as follows:

	-Per assessment: there are many different assessments of each type that follow a single course,
	 and there are several students who partake in each assessment.
	-Per assessment type: while there are less assessment types such as tests, practicals, tutorials, 
	 exams, etc., it still follows that this aspect is highly granular.
	-Per semester/exam mark: this encompasses the individual marks of students and the results they
	 achieved throughout the semester in relation to their exam mark.
	-Per overall mark: this determines the student's academic standing in the course; it consists of their
	 various assessment marks as well as their results for examinations.
	-Per course: this encompasses all students administered for that course as well as their assessment 
	 marks and average for that specific course.

These levels need to be considered in the subdivision of the system and accomodated in the program.

The application can be further subdivided by its architechtural components:

	-The interface: to provide an interface via an API to the system.
	-API: to facilitate the interactions between the user and the system.
	-Client-Server communication: also provided by the API.
	-Back-end: receives information such as user details, performs databse 
	 operations, validates information, collects data relevant to queries 
 	and commands given by the user through the API.
